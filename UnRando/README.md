# UnRando

A [Randomizer 4](https://github.com/homothetyhk/RandomizerMod) connection which randomizes items by check count only, instead of location.

This connection greatly reduces the rng of randomizer races, allowing "check velocity", or checks-per-minute, to be the only meaningful factor in determining the victor of a race. Two players playing the same seed will always find item X first, item Y second, item Z third, etc., regardless of _where_ they go to find these items.
